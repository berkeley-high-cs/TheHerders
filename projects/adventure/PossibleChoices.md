read inscription
inspect

make read into look closely, then have it work on the inscription, butchers table, throne, and goblin. (maybe big door, and chest, telling where the keys might come from) the text then says what is there, like the keys or chest, and then the player can use or grab whatever. This means they could just grab key immidiatley. (make goblin inspect/ look closley different than dead goblin)

drawing of map

[butcher table with key under meat and buthcer knife][locked chest with sword inside][empty]
[empty][grand hallway, inscription][throne, chest behind throne]
[key from grand chest in goblin (make combat?) pocket][grand exit door, get key from grand chest behind throne]

inscription: The keys three you will need
            from butchers table cleaned to chest 
            the one that bleeds has another
            and behind the throne secrets smothered

            goal of game leave out grand exit door
            neccesary route, grab key from butcher table, grab sword from locked chest, kill goblin and loot it to get key to throne chest which has a fat large key to open grand exit

Mr seibel says : make it so every item in a room has its own inspect method that returns the string when it needs to, and have something to change those descriptions. allows for more freedom.
